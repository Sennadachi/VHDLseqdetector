# VHDLseqdetector
Sequence Detector written in VHDL for an Artix-7 FPGA 

This project uses the Nexys Video FPGA development & testing board

.XPR is a Vivado project file

assignment.vhd is the VHDL code

NexysVideoGeneral.xdc is the constraints file for the board

The sequence is 4,2,2,3,1

The buttons are assigned such that:

btnl = 1

btnu =  2

btnr = 3

btnd = 4

btnc = reset
